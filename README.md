# Phishing Simulator

> 🚧 **Note:** This project is still in development and will be published to the web once it’s fully functional.

## 📝 Description

Phishing is one of the most common online threats today. It’s surprisingly easy for people — especially those who aren't trained — to fall for realistic-looking scams. That’s where this project comes in!

The **Phishing Simulator** is designed to help you train your audience (parents, grandparents, friends — anyone!) to spot phishing attempts in a safe and controlled environment.
